# VERY EARLY CONCEPTUAL 

Rework manufactories to utalize manufactured tradegood system, eg:
	- Water Purifier - Change irradiated water to clean, would need to turn most provinces with clean water to irradiated and add building 
	- Casino - Change tradegood to gambling, would need to turn most provinces with gambling to something else and add building 
	- Radioactive Plant - Change radioactive waste into something useful in the Lategame, perhaps related to nuke system
	- More? 
	
Unique Buildings:
	- Remove immediate effects such as powerpoints as it can be cheesed 
	
New Tadegoods
	- Tribal Medicine - Can spawn if tribal and NOT a raider state, tribal (non-raider) would no longer spawn drugs or medicine
	- Robot parts - Represents the pre-war robot shops, scrapyards etc. Higher frequency to spawn in Midwest 
	- Americana - Would be spawnable post Americana institution by anyone (regardless of adopting the institution), with the exception of the communist states 
	- Consider breaking up Alcohol into a few different subdrinks, with larger regional spawn variants, could then have competative market events for the different Alcohol
	- Wood, largest spawnrates in Appalachia and Midwest 
	- Other regional tradegoods, to add tactical reasons for expanding into different areas. Possable regional distinctions below
		 > Canada Primary
			 o Sporting Goods - Spawn primarily in Canada but also in a ruined metropoles but with a low chance 
		 > Midwest primary
			 o Unique Alcohol varient? 
		 > Nevada
			 o Sunset Sarsaparilla
			 o Coyote tobacco chew (possibly rename) 
		 > Appalachia 
			 o Milk/Cream, could also related to a reworked manufactory system? 
			 o Unique Alcohol varient? 
		 > Mexico
			 o Unique Alcohol varient? 
		 > Far Harbour (Future patch maybe?, would require its addition)
			 o Vim 
		 > Islands & Caribbeans
			 o Blubber OR Giant Seacreatures 
		 	o Crab meat 
		 > Commonwealth
			 o Unique Alcohol varient? 
			 o Something else unique?
