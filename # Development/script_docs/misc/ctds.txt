#------------------------------
# Crashes
#------------------------------
During Gameplay:
 - On monthly tick:
  - Map definitions have unused but defined province ID in continent/native/tradenode/trade_company
   - Causes crash in Nudge if switched to political mapmode
   

During "Loading Databases" 	
- If you are using the defines.lua, check you have included all the entries that vanilla includes.
- Check that there are no references to non-existing files.
- A tag in country_tags must not reference a file that does not exist.
- Make sure that all defined colonial regions have at least one province assigned.
- Scripted Effect / Meta Script with wrongly coded (leads to stack overflow exception) -> conditional input not used correctly, [] used for something thats not an conditional input e.g. - , non closed $input$ like $input

During "Initializing Maplogic"
- Check that the gamelogic map images have been saved in the correct formats. Make sure the map files used follows the guidelines listed in Map modding.
- default.map province limit isn't higher than the last province ID in definition.csv.
- A province ID in default.map no longer exists in the definition.csv.
- A province ID in adjacencies.txt no longer exists in the definition.csv.
- A province ID in area.txt no longer exists in the definition.csv.
- A province ID in climate.txt no longer exists in the definition.csv.
- A province ID in continent.txt no longer exists in the definition.csv.
- A province ID in terrain.txt no longer exists in the definition.csv.
- A province ID in trade_winds.txt no longer exists in the definition.csv.
- A province ID in area.txt no longer exists in the definition.csv.
- terrain.bmp has a missing or corrupted color table.
- rivers.bmp has a missing or corrupted color table.
- trees.bmp has a missing or corrupted color table.
- Map dimensions are not a product of 128.
- The provinces.bmp exceeds 52 megabytes.
- The provinces.bmp contains provinces that are too large.

During "Loading History Files..."
- Check that the history files do not reference any missing country tags or provinces IDs.

During "Loads Flags..."
- Check that the history files do not reference any missing country tags (specifically the diplomacy folder).

During "Loading Graphics..."
- Check that the graphical map images have been saved in the correct formats. Make sure the map files used follows the guidelines listed in Map modding.

During "Loading Map (Creating Straits)..."
- 
Check that the adjacencies.txt file lists valid straits.

Clicking Play in the lobby 	The issue can lie within the common files:
- Missing entries in required files such as static_modifiers
- Missing entries for modifiers used in effects or triggers.

History files:
- A country capital defined in history/countries references a province id that has no pixels in map/provinces.bmp.

Clicking a Province
- Make sure the province belongs to a continent in continent.txt.
- Make sure the province belongs to an area in area.txt.

Nation Designer Government Tab when using more than 3 Government Ranks
- The nationadesignerview.gui file needs to be edited to have additional icon_gov_desc_* and gov_desc_* for each new level of government rank.

Crash on Hover in an Interface
- Typically caused by a clause missing from the relevant files, i.e. the army professionalism static modifiers when hovering over the Hire General button. It may also be caused by errors in on_actions.txt.

Trying to Move a Capital
- Often caused by missing or misnumbered provinces in continent.txt.

Hovering over a country in the Great Powers list
- Also often caused by missing or misnumbered provinces in continent.txt.
