# Changelog
#-----------------------------
- Changed truce timer to base 2 years, 3 years scaled.
- Adjusted the base colonial range so you can't colonise beyond immediate neighbor provinces in the first 100 years.
- Reduced the amount of colonial settler growth you get so colonisation is slower.
- Adjusted the sources of governing capacity so you start off with less.
- Increased the DIP cost of establishing a Frontier Settlement (Siberian Frontier) to 100.
- Added pop system: each province can have up to 21 types of pop. Each type of pop can be small, medium or large. Each pop is represented by a province modifier, and confers a bonus and penalty linked somewhat to what they represent.
- These are the following pop types added:
 - Wastelander
 - Raider
 - Tribal
 - Robot
 - Super Mutant
 - Ghoul
 - Swampfolk
 - Synth
 - Rodent
 - Beastlord
 - Zetan
 - Deathclaw
 - Spore Carrier
 - Dwarf
 - Legion
 - Brotherhood of Steel
 - Children of Atom
 - Vault Dweller
 - Institute
 - Enclave
 - Shi
- Added Population Attraction 'building': lets you boost the size of a pop type or attract a new type to the province.
- Added Population Expulsion 'building: lets you expel a pop type, sending it to another state, and granting temporary bonses for culture/religion conversion.
- Added Population Decimation 'building: lets you kill a pop type, granting big temporary bonses for culture/religion conversion but with significant unrest.
- Added 'Pop' Administration system. You gain bonuses based on the pop type that leads your government. This is set by default at game start in a logical way (i.e. Caesar's Legion has Legion Administration). However, this can be changed by amassing enough of another pop type in your provinces, allowing you to adopt their type of administration. Each administration assigns powerful bonses and penalties that align with their theme. Switching will also change your technology group/unit type in most circumstances.
