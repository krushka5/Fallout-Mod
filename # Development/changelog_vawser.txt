# Ages
- The age abilities have been changed to a more dynamic system:

 - Once unlocked, the Innovation event will fire.
 - Within this menu, you can browse 11 categories:
  - Administrative
  - Court
  - Economic
  - Technology
  - Societal
  - Diplomatic
  - Espionage
  - Colonial
  - Army
  - Navy
  - Action
 - Each category has an array of bonuses to select from. Once a bonus has been selected, the menu will close.
 - For each age, only one bonus from each category can be selected, i.e. if you pick an Administrative bonus, the next unlock will not show the Administrative category in the menu.
 - These bonuses will persist between ages however.
