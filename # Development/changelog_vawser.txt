# Scavenging
- Added the ability to sent out Scavenging Expeditions. These have a chance to find schematics, which provide permanent bonuses, or stashes such as pipe pistols, etc, which award caps.
 - You can focus the expedition on a specific schematic for a cost of ducats. This will narrow the reward roll down to the schematic and the stashes, with the schematic being much higher than in the random focus.
  - The cost of focusing varies based on the nation 'type':
   - Primitive: 500
   - Urban: 300
   - Scientific: 150

# Schematics
- Added 53 schematics, each provides a small bonus when obtained.
- Once discovered via a scavenging expedition a schematic cannot be discovered elsewhere.
- However, nations can use the "Steal Schematic" peace term to steal 1 schematic from a nation (assuming they have any).
- Annexation of a nation will cause the annexer to inherit all of the annexed's schematics.

# Status Report
- Added "Compile Report on Scavenging Expedition" menu:
 - This shows you the current expedition progress.
 - Allows you to force expedition progress in exchange for a ducat cost.
 - Allows you to end the expedition if the expedition events are troublesome.
 
- Added "Compile Report on Schematics" menu:
 - Lets the player view if schematics are discovered, and if so who owns them.

# Diplomatic Action
- Molecular Relay unlocks the "Teleport Army" diplomatic action. This allows the owner (the Institute by default) to teleport an army within their own provinces to an enemy province instantly. Costs 50 MIL Power.
- Molecular Relay unlocks the "Recall Army" diplomatic action. This allows the owner (the Institute by default) to recall an army in hostile territory to the capital. Costs 20 MIL Power.

# GFX
- Changed the model used by Robot graphical culture to the Securitron instead of the generic soldier.
