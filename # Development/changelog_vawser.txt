# Scavenging
- Added the ability to sent out Scavenging Expeditions. These have a chance to find schematics, which provide permanent bonuses, or stashes such as pipe pistols, etc, which award caps.
 - You can focus the expedition on a specific schematic for a cost of ducats. This will narrow the reward roll down to the schematic and the stashes, with the schematic being much higher than in the random focus.
  - The cost of focusing varies based on the nation 'type':
   - Primitive: 500
   - Urban: 300
   - Scientific: 150

# Schematics
- Added 53 schematics, each provides a small bonus when obtained.
- Once discovered via a scavenging expedition a schematic cannot be discovered elsewhere.
- Annexation of a nation will cause the annexer to inherit all of the annexed's schematics.
