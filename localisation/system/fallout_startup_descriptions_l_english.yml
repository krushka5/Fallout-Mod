 # History
 string_start_tag_generic:0 "Some would say that the [Root.GovernmentName] of §Y[Root.GetName]§! is a country with an insignificant past. While this is clearly more jealousy than truth, our past is not as important as the glorious future in store for our people."
 string_start_history_enclave: "The Enclave is a nation state established after the Great War, formed by members of the pre-War United States shadow government[5] and military industrial complex. It claims authority over the territory of the United States of America, considering itself the legal continuation of the U.S. government and styling itself as such. Relative to other human societies throughout the wasteland, it is extremely small. Control station Enclave, the single largest concentration of Enclave population in the wasteland, was home to between a hundred and a thousand inhabitants. By comparison, the largest city in the wasteland built from scratch, Shady Sands is home to 3,000 citizens alone.\n\nThe Enclave exercises control of a number of military bases scattered across the former United States. However, their primary strongholds were destroyed by various factions throughout the 23rd century, including their headquarters and capital in 2242.\n\nWith only remnants remaining in Chicago, enforcing their authority over the wasteland has become much more difficult."
 string_start_history_legion: "Caesar's Legion is an autocratic, ultra-reactionary, utilitarian slaver army founded in 2247 by Edward Sallow and Joshua Graham. It is largely inspired and partially based on the ancient Roman Empire, though it isn't the Roman Empire or the Roman Republic or even its military, the Legion. It is a slave army with trappings of foreign-conscripted Roman legionaries during the late empire. All military, no civilian, and with none of the supporting civilian culture.\n\nIts legionaries are predominately reconditioned tribals, slave soldiers forming a well-organized, culturally insular fighting force that, as of 2281, mainly operates east of the Colorado River and the Grand Canyon, in the former states of Arizona and New Mexico with small portions of Utah and Colorado. Caesar's ultimate goal is to conquer the New California Republic and merge its civilian culture and infrastructure with the military strength of the Legion, creating a new totalitarian empire."
 string_start_history_ncr: "The New California Republic is a federal presidential republic founded in New California, comprised of five contiguous states and additional territories and holdings in pre-War regions in Nevada, Utah, Arizona, Oregon, and parts of Mexico.\n\nThe Republic dedicates itself to the values of the old world: Democracy, liberty, the rule of law, all in order to make the wasteland a better place. However, its policies resulted in difficulties in recent years, with the threat of Caesar's Legion ever looming."
 string_start_history_new_vegas: "New Vegas, originally known as Las Vegas in the Wasteland before Robert House revived its reconstruction, is a city upon the remains of Las Vegas, located in southern Nevada.\n\nIn 2274, the New California Republic attempted to annex New Vegas to take control of Hoover Dam. Mr. House, ever vigilant, took to securing the Strip and created the Three Families to protect it. Posed with the threat of military losses, the New California Republic negotiated with Mr. House and agreed to permit the Strip's existence in exchange for 95% of Hoover Dam's power output. New Vegas benefits greatly from the tourism and from the protection of the NCR against Legion incursions."
 string_start_history_shi: "The Shi are a major faction in the San Francisco area of California. They are primarily reclusive researchers who prefer to stay out of wasteland politics.\n\nThe ancestors of the present-day Shi were the crewmen of a Chinese submarine, the Shi-huang-ti, that was beached in San Francisco shortly after the Great War. Despite the extreme levels of radiation persisting in the burning ruins of the city, they managed to establish a foothold in the city. Gradually, the submarine was stripped of its subsystems, as they found a new purpose serving the Shi, as the group of survivors came to call themselves. Eventually, even the Emperor, the submarine's mainframe, was moved to the mainland and installed in the newly built Steel Palace, created from metal salvaged from the submarine."
 string_start_history_brotherhood_of_steel: "Brotherhood of Steel is a techno-religious paramilitary organization with characteristics of a military order, founded by deserters from the United States Army security detail at Mariposa Military Base and their families, dedicated to controlling and regulating technology in the wasteland.\n\nIn the West, the Brotherhood is struggling to survive against the New California Republic and its regional hegemony over technology."
 string_start_history_brotherhood_of_steel_washington: "Brotherhood of Steel is a techno-religious paramilitary organization with characteristics of a military order, founded by deserters from the United States Army security detail at Mariposa Military Base and their families, dedicated to controlling and regulating technology in the wasteland.\n\nIn the East, the Brotherhood is dominant. Having eliminated the Enclave remnants in the Capital Wasteland durin ghte Purifier Conflict, they are now establishing outposts in the Boston area."
 string_start_history_new_reno: "The capital of sin and prominently known for its casinos, the Shark Club and the Desperado, and total freedom with abundance of prostitutes, alcohol and drugs. New Reno is home to a substantial weapons outfiter dubbed New Reno Arms. The town in 2241 was once run by four different families: the Mordinos, the Bishops, the Wrights, and the Salvatores. Now in [GetYear], all of the original families more or less retain their power with the exception of the Salvatores and Mordinos. The city is now run by the Wrights, while also being contested by a new crime family, the Van Graffs."
 string_start_history_vault_city: "Vault City is a high-tech settlement in West Nevada, established by the inhabitants of Vault 8 after the Great War, which is best known for their medical technology, most advanced within New California. In [GetYear], it is all but part of the New California Republic, although its distance from Shady Sands grants it a large amount of autonomy."
 string_start_history_great_khans: "Once the Great Khans were the single most organized tribe in the wasteland and effectively its rulers. However after the battle for Bitter Springs, easy access to narcotics has led to many Great Khans becoming addicts, trying to cope with the trauma of Bitter Springs through alcohol and hard drugs. Red Rock Canyon, already desolate before their arrival, became little more than a drug den filled with the stench of alcohol and drug fumes, where even the flies buzzing around are hopped up on one drug or another.\n\nPapa Khan, the Great Khans head has grown intolerant of this, and wishes to continue the Great Khans once great legacy. Caesar, aware of the Great Khans situation, sent Frumentarius Karl to act as ambassador to the Khans and to secure their allegiance against the New California Republic."
 string_start_history_institute: "The Institute is a legendary nation of scientists, an advanced subterranean metropolis, a technological marvel unlike anything seen on the surface of the Commonwealth.\n\nIsolated from the outside world, the scientists continued their work, disregarding the mayhem and destruction occurring outside of its grounds. As they worked on creating synths, they attempted to work peacefully with the people of the Commonwealth using first generation synths, but mutual mistrust ended that relationship quickly and they returned to isolation. Eventually, the scientists have utterly put ubiquitous pre-War technology to shame. Wastelanders would be unlikely to understand the sheer scope of the Institute's achievement, most notably the creation of the molecular relay in the 2180s, which resulted in the Institute sealing itself off from the surface permanently, and the development of synths.\n\nFor decades, the first and second generation synths were the most visible part of the Institute's operations, scavenging for materials and performing experiments for the scientists below."
 string_start_history_railroad: "The Railroad is a secret network operating in the Commonwealth in direct opposition to the Institute.\n\nThe origins of the organization are murky and lost to time, due to the numerous times the organization was nearly wiped out. But their mission statement has remained clear. The Railroad stands by the doctrine that, even as machines, self-aware androids look, behave, think and feel as humans do, entitling them to the freedom intrinsically enjoyed by human beings as well as emancipation from their owners.
 string_start_history_minutemen: "Founded by ordinary folk of the Commonwealth, the Minutemen are dedicated to the protection of their home, the Commonwealth, from outside threats. Their first major action was the defense of Diamond City in 2180 from a horde of super mutants. As they rose to prominence, the Minutemen became known as citizen soldiers, protecting the Commonwealth and its people so that they could decide their own future. However, as the years went by and their influence grew, Minutemen leaders gradually forgot their ideals - and with it came decline and defeat.\n\nDespite a long and respectable tradition, the group has fallen into disarray in recent years, due to a string of disastrous defeats, the single biggest hit being the loss of The Castle to Mirelurks in 2240, after a queen mirelurk decided she fancies the location. The loss of their headquarters, radio station, and General McGann sent the Commonwealth Minutemen into disarray. Without artillery support and their resources, they were picked off one by one.\n\nAfter the death of Becker in 2282 no one could agree whom would lead the Minutemen next. This fracturing would lead to the collapse of the organisation. Now in [GetYear], Preston Garvey leads what remains of the Minutemen, hoping to re-establish them as a force of good within the Commonwealth."
 string_start_history_powder_gangers: "The Powder Gangers are a gang of escaped prisoners acting as raiders operating in the Mojave Wasteland. In the distant past, the NCR Correctional Facility was the Jean Conservancy, a low-security all-female prison. When the NCR occupied the Mojave, it became a perfect spot to house prisoners on a work release program.\n\nThe inmates were tasked with maintaining a railroad alongside the Long 15 under military supervision, keeping the vital link between the Boneyard and New Vegas alive.\n\nHowever, as the war with the Legion escalated, more and more prison guards were redeployed to the Colorado against the warden's objections. Coupled with the fact that the inmates routinely worked with explosives to blast through rock or old train cars littering the tracks and were used as essentially slave labor for a major infrastructure project in grueling conditions, an uprising was a question of time.\n\nUnder the lead of Samuel Cooke, a small group of inmates gathered weapons and explosives before rebelling against the military police staffing the facility. \n\nBlasting their way out of the cell block, they quickly overwhelmed what little NCR personnel was present at the site, killed the warden, and established their own rule. The prisoner population dispersed, with some following Cooke into Vault 19, others staying with Eddie as Powder Gangers, and some heading out to cause mayhem throughout the Long 15. \n\nThe revolt shut down Highway 93 and the NCR's main road to Vegas. The situation worsened when the Powder Gangers stole Sloan's dynamite supply, shutting down Quarry Junction and inadvertently unleashing deathclaws on the quarry and the highway. Eventually, the gangers established a sizable presence outside the prison, with a ring of camps around it, focused on raiding caravans that tried to push through to Vegas and launch attacks to terrorize the local towns of Goodsprings, Sloan and Primm."
 string_start_history_big_mt: "The Big Mountain Research and Development Center, alternately known as Big MT and the Big Empty, was a privately owned pre-War defense contractor and research center located in the Southwest Commonwealth.\n\nThe Big MT Research and Development Center was originally built inside a cave system running underneath a large mountain peak (hence the name). Their goal was to build the future of mankind and create the technology of tomorrow without restraints, either moral or technical. It welcomed some of the most gifted pre-War scientists, who plumbed the depths of many experimental technological fields. The research conducted within was as groundbreaking as it was unethical, conducted in part on living humans (both American volunteers and Chinese-American detainees). Big MT even included a concentration camp of its very own, safeguarded by lucrative contracts with the U.S. Army, such as the X-42 giant robo-scorpion.\n\nWhen the Great War came, it didn't stop the research efforts; it merely put them on a different rail. Mobius worked on predicting the post-holocaust economic systems. A new project was also started, with the purpose of preserving the Big MT 'Think Tank' executives by transforming them into a special brain bot named after their group, allowing them to continue their work at Big MT indefinitely, but 'reprogrammed' to forget a part of their personality and their name, by giving them a new one, enforcing the recursion loop in their new perception programming. With no body to stand in the way, their research continued, becoming more sinister and debauched as the years went by."
 string_start_history_zion: "The caves of Zion National Park was the site of several United States Geological Survey research stations that were abandoned during the Great War. The canyon was spared most of the horrors of the Great War, and remains an unspoiled wilderness. In the immediate aftermath of the war only one man is known to have inhabited Zion - a survivalist by the name of Randall Clark who used the Fallen Rock cave USGS research site as shelter from the radioactive fallout. According to him, a black rain fell on Zion a little more than a week after the war, followed by green and glowing snowfall in January 2078 and Zion was safe to explore for short periods by the end of January.\n\nOnce it was completely safe to wander outside, Clark began to camp out in the park, and slowly lose his mind. In September of 2095, a group of Mexicans came to the area, calling it "paradise." Clark watched the Mexicans, never making contact but subtly aiding them when they needed it. In 2096, a group of Vault 22 dwellers, infected with Beauveria mordicana, arrived in the area, killing and eating the Mexicans, with Clark unable to rescue them. Out of a sense for vengeance, Clark conducted an ten month long campaign of seek-and-destroy operations on the vault dwellers, killing most of them or waiting for them to die of their infection. However, not all the vault dwellers fell at the hand of Clark and he befriended Sylvie, who was caught in a bear trap, and ended up having a child with her. She died during childbirth from an overdose of meds and the child was stillborn.\n\nIn 2108, feral ghouls arrived in the area, but Clark was able to kill them all before they became a problem. Fifteen years later, in 2123, a group of children arrived in the area, in the same location where the Mexicans had encamped all those years ago. Clark, now an old man, watched over the children as he did with the Mexicans, making sure that no harm came to them but never making contact with them. To the children, he was 'the Father in the Cave', a purveyor of gifts and dispenser of wisdom.  The children became the Sorrows, a peaceful tribe that embodied innocence, and lived in peace for years, never venturing into the caves and treating all pre-War buildings and tech as taboo.\n\nThe peace was not to last. Recently, missionaries from New Canaan in the north have arrived in the region, attempting to convert the locals to Mormonism. That in itself would not have been a threat to the peace, but the White Legs, a hostile group with whom the Mormon Church is embroiled in a conflict, have followed the surviving Mormons down to Zion, where the Sorrows now face extinction. Daniel and Joshua Graham, ridden with guilt over their part in the Sorrows' current predicament, have vowed to protect the tribe by any means. Daniel wants to evacuate the Sorrows to the Grand Staircase, where they cannot be followed by the White Legs, and thus abandoning their traditional home. But Graham, with his Dead Horses, want to teach the Sorrows the art of warfare so that they may drive the White Legs out of Zion and secure the region for future generations. Either option will require the tribe to sacrifice a fundamental part of their identity, but a decision must be made nonetheless."
