 WILD_WASTELAND_NAME: "Wild Wasteland"
 WILD_WASTELAND_DESC: "The aftermath of the Courier collapsed both the New California Republic and Caesar's Legion. In the chaos, numerous factions rose up from the ashes of them, whilst other migrated to greener pastures.\n\nIn the east, the Enclave fled from Chicago, having failed to secure their headquarters there, to a bunker deep within the wastes of Washington."
