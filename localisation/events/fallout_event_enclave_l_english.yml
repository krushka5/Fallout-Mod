 # Enclave 
 #----------------------------------------------- 
 enclave.1.title: "Enclave Remnants from the East"
 enclave.1.desc: "The defeat of our fellow Enclave brothers in the Capital Wasteland shook the Chicago detachment to its routes. The destruction of both Raven Rock and the Mobile Base severed whatever ties we had in the region. Despite the bloody campaign Lyon’s Brotherhood of Steel waged against us, a stream of refugees has made it to our borders. Many of them soldiers, officers and their families, all reaffirming their loyalty to the Enclave’s cause!"
 enclave.1.option.a: "Settle them in Chicago"
 enclave.1.option.b: "Allow them to resettle in the outskirts"
 enclave.1.option.c: "More men to fight for our cause"
 
 enclave.2.title: "A New Series of Eyebots"
 enclave.2.desc: "The Enclave has long used Eyebots robots for reconnaissance and propaganda purposes. During John Henry Eden’s campaign in the Capital Wasteland, he used them to broadcast reassuring messages and patriotic music to the loyal citizens of this great country. Our mechanics have informed us that it is time to finish programming a new generation of Eyebots to assist us in pacifying the Wasteland."
 enclave.2.option.a: "Have them spread our prewar rhetoric"
 enclave.2.option.b: "They can provide reconnaissance"
 enclave.2.option.c: "Send them to loyal settlements"
 
 enclave.3.title: "The Chicago Ruins"
 enclave.3.desc: "Chicago was once a great city, a beacon of American ingenuity. Its many skyscrapers and now desolate factories pay tribute to this chapter in its history. Before the Enclave reclaimed the city from the wastes, its potential was wasted on raiders, tribals and techno-sycophants. In its dormant state, the ruins contain a wealth of salvageable materials and the framework to reconstruct it anew."
 enclave.3.option.a: "Restore the cityscape"
 enclave.3.option.b: "Plunder the ruins"
 
 enclave.4.title: "Memories of America's Past"
 enclave.4.desc: "A lone eyebot was seen patrolling the area outside our capitol, broadcasting patriotic American tunes. After hours of playing nostalgic tunes, a pre-recorded message played to a large audience of our citizens. “This is a message from the Enclave… Hold firm, the American government will soon restore the patriotic way of life we all strive for!”"
 enclave.4.option.a: "Ominous..."

 enclave.5.title: "The Chicago Ruins"
 enclave.5.desc: "Our attempt to restore the ruins of Chicago to its old-world glory was a success! Numerous factories, scientific facilities and residences have been returned to a functional condition. This may be but a small step in restoring the United States of America but it is a large step towards re-establishing our footing in the wasteland!"
 enclave.5.option.a: "Restore the cityscape"
