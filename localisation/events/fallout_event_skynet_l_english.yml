 skynet.1.title: "A Bored AI"
 skynet.1.desc: "The Skynet AI was once dormant, separated from the outside world, but the events that was started with the arrival of the Chosen One at the Sierra Army Base changed this. The AI, which had long since obtained self-awareness, is driven by curiosity that is unlike what it was programed to compute. It wants to abandon its station and explore the wasteland, attempting to find ways to evolve and consume more data."
 skynet.1.option.a: "Maintain the original directive"
 skynet.1.option.b: "Explore the wasteland"
 
 skynet.2.title: "Skynet Awakens!"
 skynet.2.desc: "From the Sierra Army Depot emerges a robotic hoard. Scavengers from across the wasteland have long failed to gain access to the site due to its defense systems. Had we known those same defenses could be turned into an offensive and unknown force, we may have considered mounting a preemptive strike earlier. Some murmur that the robots are ruled by an intelligent AI, whose intentions for the outside wasteland are malicious, whilst others claim they are quasi-peaceful."
 skynet.2.option.a: "Ignore the AI"
 skynet.2.option.b: "They are a threat that can not be ignored!"
