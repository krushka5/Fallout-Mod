 capital_wasteland.1.title: "Enclave Remnants"
 capital_wasteland.1.desc: "The defeat of the Enclave by the Lone Wanderer and Brotherhood of Steel scattered the once powerful organization into bands of outposts. Many of these outposts have been conducting research to attempt to discover a way to regain the advantage and assist them in conquering the Capital Wasteland, whilst others are on the verge of revolt. Moving forward we must decide on how to approach these outposts."

 capital_wasteland.2.d: "The Enclave research post was taken by surprise during our ambush. In the centre of the outpost was a research terminal which outlined the mission of this base. It was conducting field tests on local mutated creatures, to identify their weaknesses and strengths. Whilst we knew much of the information contained on the terminal, the Enclave’s scientific approach identified details we had not observed."
 capital_wasteland.2.da: "As our forces approached the Enclave outpost, a hail of gunfire rained down, slowing our advance. During the gunfight, an Enclave officer was shot dead and a member of the taskforce obtained some form of ID card from his corpse. As that individual breached the outpost, he found no enclave soldiers, only turrets. The ID card was a part of an experiment in turret automation, which was conducted to determine the field efficiency of automated turrets ability to distinguish verified users from foes."

A traveling trader has passed information onto us that she recently died of natural causes and he possessed the last of her musical notes. Agatha, on top of producing her own music, wrote down the sheet music for many of the pre-wars most gifted musical minds (many of whose works were believed to be lost). \n\nDespite the advent of her death, the trader has signalled the event as an opportunity. The trader has declared he will hold an auction to profit off her works and give the opportunity to wastelanders to purchase her works."
