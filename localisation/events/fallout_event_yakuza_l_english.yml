 yakuza.1.title: "Yakuza Traditions"
 yakuza.1.desc: "The Yakuza has endured as a close-nit gang since before the Great War. The leadership of the gang are the descendants of the Japanese Yakuza which operated behind the scenes in the Western United States. Now, the gang struggles for survival in the wasteland, between human and mutant enemies. Some of the younger members of the gang believe we should abandon our traditions and adapt to the challenges the wasteland has to offer, whilst others hold true to our traditional code of honor."
