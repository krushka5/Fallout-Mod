 fiends.1.title: "Fiends Raid Drug Caravan"
 fiends.1.desc: "The desperation of many tribals under our rule for chems risks exploding into an act of aggression against one of our important dealers. The Great Khan’s dealers have long been under our protection but some elements in our ranks want to conduct a raid against some of their caravans.\n\nStopping this act before it occurs would anger a number of addicts. Not acting could harm our position with the Great Khans, who are the majority provider of chems in this area of Nevada."
 fiends.1.option.a: "Stop it"
 fiends.1.option.b: "Allow the raid"
