 sloan.2.title: "A Pitstop to New Vegas"
 sloan.2.desc: "Sloan has typically been one of the only towns along Interstate 15 placing it in an important position as one of two major routes to New Vegas. \n\nAlthough the area has became significantly more dangerous with heightening tensions in the region, by converting the mess hall into a bar we might be able to make Sloan an attractive stop for those seeking to visit New Vegas in more peaceful times."

 sloan.3.title: "Chem Package Arrived"
 sloan.3.desc: "We have long maintained secret drug smuggling operations with an operative from Sloan, which was one of the more lucrative routes south of Vegas. \n\nFor a long time this trade went silent, forcing a reliance on trade with groups such as the Fiends. \n\nOne of our scouts Melissa Lewis, returned today with a shipment of drugs from the south, signalling a return of trade in the region and opening new frontiers into the future."
