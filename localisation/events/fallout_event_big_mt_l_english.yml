 big_mountain.1.title: "A Shift in Focus"
 big_mountain.1.desc: "With the presence of intruders in the Big Empty and the continued disruptions of the villainous Doctor Mobius, perhaps a focused approach at research will allow the Think Tank to overcome its adversaries with."
 big_mountain.1.option.a: "We should refine our techniques at spawning Lobotomites!"
 big_mountain.1.option.b: "Restarting the Cyberdog splicing is our priority!"
 big_mountain.1.option.c: "We should rebuild Big Mountain!"
 
 big_mountain.2.title: "A Dogbowl of Psycho"
 big_mountain.2.desc: "The recent acquisition of drugs evoked memories of past research projects. If we imbue our cyber dogs with Psycho we can expect to achieve enhanced aggression." 
 big_mountain.2.option.a: "The results will be mind blowing"
 
 big_mountain.3.title: "X-8 research facility"
 big_mountain.3.desc: "With the X-8 Facility back under our control, we will once again be able to commit to unrestrained biomechanical science."
 big_mountain.3.option.a: "Let's get to splicing!"
 
 big_mountain.4.title: "Irregularities amongst Lobotomites"
 big_mountain.4.desc: "Recently Lobotomites have been congregating in a cave called The Cuckoo's Nest instead of standard skinvelope behaviour. They seem to be accumulating toasters for some form of primitive worship."
 big_mountain.4.option.a: "Their only gods are US and SCIENCE!"
 big_mountain.4.option.b: "It'll be interesting to observe..."
 big_mountain.4.option.c: "I wonder if we can replicate this behaviour?"
 
 big_mountain.5.title: "Toaster Primacy"

 big_mountain.5.option.a: "We will see this experiment through to its end!"
 big_mountain.5.option.b:  "Disassemble this THING immediately!"
 
 big_mountain.6.title: "Hexcrete Constructions"
 big_mountain.6.desc: "The Hexcrete Archipelago stands monument to one of the Think Tanks greatest failures, a new architectural form of construction of concrete towers that served no purpose.Examining out study notes we may have found an area of which we discovered that buildings function better hollow.We could make minor adjustments and attempt to revive the project?"
 big_mountain.6.option.a: "This can only be good"
 big_mountain.6.option.b: "Let's develop instead"
 
 big_mountain.7.title: "Success in the Hexcrete Archipelago"
 big_mountain.7.desc: "Our attempts to revolutionize heavy construction was a success, concrete prisms now dot the landscape of the Big Empty centred around the Hexcrete Archipelago."
 big_mountain.7.option.a: "As expected"

 big_mountain.8.title: "A Shift in Focus"
 big_mountain.8.desc: "For years Mobius has attempted to restrain the unrestrained scientific vigour with mixed tactics, from armies of Robo-Scorpions to erasing the memory of the Think Tank. With outside intruders penetrating the Big Mountain, perhaps a focused approach is necessary."
 big_mountain.8.option.a: "More Robo-Scorpions"
 big_mountain.8.option.b: "A less direct measure"
